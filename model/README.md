# 3D_U-Net_CNN

The 'model_3D-Unet_generator.py' file is the cleanest and most efficient version. As metioned in my report, it is the one with an adjusted architecture complexity.

The 'model_3D-Unet.py' file is coupled with the 'Data_generator.py' file but it is the less efficient version. I have left it just in case. You can find there many different loss functions that you might find useful.

The 'testing.py' file is a mess because of all the different tries and ways to test. I would suggest creating a new file and starting over for that part which I think isn't that complicated.
